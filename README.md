# Wine-EDA
In this project, we will be predicting the quality of wine depending on the various factors. Various libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to buildt this project. In order to get better visualization of the data, I have plotted various types of plots like histogram, heatmap, pairplot, boxplot, piechart and lineplot. This plots help to co-relate various factors i our dataset. Then, I have evaluated my model based on five types of algorithms which include Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine. The top accuracy of 74.92% for this dataset was given by RandomForest algorithm followed by GaussianNB algorithm of 71.15% and then by Decision Tree algorithm of 68.96%. Very less accuracy of 52.03% and 49.84% was given by KNN and SVM algorithm respectively.
